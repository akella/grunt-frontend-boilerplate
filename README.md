My Grunt Boilerplate &copy; akella
=============
For generic frontend development. Mostly small to medium projects, and without some heavy JS.


`src` - source of the project, where all the development should happen

`production` - code we are sending to client. All preprocessors compiled, css-js-images concatenated and minified.

How to run it
=============
 - You need to have _npm_ installed now, as well as a _grunt_.
 - Download files, and go to this project folder in terminal. Type `npm install` (this will install some libraries for it to work). Folder `node_moduldes` might appear. Don't be afraid.
 - Run `grunt`, and it will watch for all the changes
